<p align="center">Windows port of the popular development environment <a href="https://github.com/laravel/valet">Laravel Valet</a>.</p>

## Introduction

Valet is a Laravel development environment for Windows. No Vagrant, no `/etc/hosts` file. You can even share your sites publicly using local tunnels. _Yeah, we like it too._

Laravel Valet configures your Windows to always run Nginx in the background when your machine starts. Then, using [Acrylic DNS](http://mayakron.altervista.org/wikibase/show.php?id=AcrylicHome), Valet proxies all requests on the `*.test` domain to point to sites installed on your local machine.

## Documentation

Before installation, make sure that no other programs such as Apache or Nginx are binding to your local machine's port 80. <br> Also make sure to open your preferred terminal (CMD, Git Bash, PowerShell, etc.) as Administrator. 

- If you don't have PHP installed, open PowerShell (3.0+) as Administrator and run: 

```bash
# PHP 7.1
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/cretueusebiu/valet-windows/raw/master/bin/php71.ps1" -OutFile $env:temp\php71.ps1; ."$env:temp\php71.ps1"

# PHP 7.2
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/cretueusebiu/valet-windows/raw/master/bin/php72.ps1" -OutFile $env:temp\php72.ps1; ."$env:temp\php72.ps1"
```

> This script will download and install PHP for you and add it to your environment path variable. PowerShell is only required for this step.

- If you don't have Composer installed, make sure to [install](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) it.

- Install Valet with Composer via `composer global require cretueusebiu/valet-windows`.

- Run the `valet install` command. This will configure and install Valet and register Valet's daemon to launch when your system starts.

- If you're installing on Windows 10, you may need to [manually configure](http://mayakron.altervista.org/wikibase/show.php?id=AcrylicWindows10Configuration) Windows to use the Acrylic DNS proxy.

Valet will automatically start its daemon each time your machine boots. There is no need to run `valet start` or `valet install` ever again once the initial Valet installation is complete.

For more please refer to the official documentation on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/valet#serving-sites).

## Known Issues

- HTTP/2 does not work with secured sites.
- When sharing sites the url will not be copied to the clipboard.
- You must run the `valet` commands from the drive where Valet is installed, except for park and link. See [#12](https://github.com/cretueusebiu/valet-windows/issues/12#issuecomment-283111834).
- If your machine is not connected to the internet you'll have to manually add the domains in your `hosts` file.
